# Make the following instantiations simultaneously:
# a = 'a', b=2, c='gamma'. (That is, in one line of code).
a, b, c = 'a', 2, "gamma"

# Create a tuple containing just a single element which
# in turn contains the three elements 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
# Verify that the length is actually 1 by using the len() function.
tup3 = (('a', 'b', 'c'), )
