"""Array binary value to an integer.

Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

Examples:
Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5
Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6
Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15
Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11

However, the arrays can have varying lengths, not just limited to 4.
